    "## Conclusion\n",
    "We started this project with analyzing the differences between to experiment groups, gathered some statistics and found out that the groups are almost identical in terms of their interactions with the Search Everywhere tab. Then, we evaluated the ranking model using two metrics: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Time-To-Click (TTC). The model seemed to perform slightly better for group 1 users in terms of MRR and for group 0 users in terms of TTC. Finally, we calculated the overall MRR and TTC for the entire dataset and combined them into a single metric called RAT. The RAT value gives us a good overview of the model's performance in terms of both ranking and time-to-click. It doesn't really tell us much about the model's performance itself, but it gives us a way to compare different models or model versions. "
